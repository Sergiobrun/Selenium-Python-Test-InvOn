# Selenium-Python-Test-InvOn
This is a project I created in a Selenium Web Driver course to implement Page Object framework automation using Selenium webdriver with Python. 
The website used is InvertirOnline, a stock trade company in Argetina.
In the project the test cases are:
- create an account
- log in the account created and buy stocks YPF stocks from the Simulator section
